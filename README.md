# The Enigma of Starfall Observatory
Embark on a cerebral journey through the Starfall Observatory in this deduction-based CTF challenge. As an intrepid sleuth, your mission is to uncover a hidden artifact concealed by the enigmatic astronomer Dr. Lysander Quill, before the elusive Nightshade Collective claims it. The clues are intricately embedded within the narrative, testing your reading comprehension and logical prowess. Carefully dissect the text to extract and interpret the cryptic hints, then deduce the artifact’s hiding place. Submit your answer as a code in the format Kur0{...}. No technical skills are required—only sharp deduction and meticulous reading, like a detective unraveling a cosmic riddle.

## Scenario
You’ve been granted access to the virtual Starfall Observatory, a mountaintop sanctum where Dr. Lysander Quill, a reclusive astronomer, once peered into the cosmos’s depths. Before his inexplicable disappearance, Dr. Quill hid his most cherished artifact, whispered to be safeguarded by “the sovereign of the heavens.” The observatory’s chambers resonate with the gentle ticks of ancient timepieces, their faces gleaming under the starlight that filters through the domed ceiling. Rumors swirl of the Nightshade Collective, a shadowy cabal of relic hunters prowling the virtual halls, intensifying the urgency of your quest.

In the central dome, a grand chamber adorned with celestial motifs, you find three imposing figures: a lion, its mane sculpted with regal pride; a bear, stout and formidable; and a hawk, its wings poised as if to soar. The lion, standing proudest among them, seems to command the space. As you explore, you notice a dusty telescope lens tucked in a darkened alcove, its surface clouded but capable of focusing light. The observatory’s keeper, a spectral voice in the text, murmurs that Dr. Quill held a deep reverence for the mysteries unveiled by the night sky, where secrets shimmer in the absence of day.

Scrawled on a weathered parchment, partially obscured by dust, you discern a cryptic inscription: “Seek the path where L precedes N, and N yields to R, for therein lies my treasure.” The words weave a puzzle, their meaning cloaked in subtlety. Nearby, one clock among the many catches your eye. Its face, etched with a peculiar mark, displays eleven o’clock, but a scratch splits the digits, rendering it as one-one-zero, followed by a solitary zero—110|0, a cipher begging interpretation. As you ponder, the Nightshade Collective’s presence looms, urging you to act swiftly. Where is the artifact hidden? Disentangle the clues from the narrative and submit the code to claim your prize.
